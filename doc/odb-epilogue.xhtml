  <h1>REGEX AND SHELL QUOTING</h1>

  <p>When entering a regular expression argument in the shell
     command line it is often necessary to use quoting (enclosing
     the argument in <code><b>"&nbsp;"</b></code> or
     <code><b>'&nbsp;'</b></code>) in order to prevent the shell
     from interpreting certain characters, for example, spaces as
     argument separators and <code><b>$</b></code> as variable
     expansions.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately it is hard to achieve this in a manner that is
     portable across POSIX shells, such as those found on
     GNU/Linux and UNIX, and Windows shell. For example, if you
     use <code><b>"&nbsp;"</b></code> for quoting you will get a
     wrong result with POSIX shells if your expression contains
     <code><b>$</b></code>. The standard way of dealing with this
     on POSIX systems is to use <code><b>'&nbsp;'</b></code> instead.
     Unfortunately, Windows shell does not remove <code><b>'&nbsp;'</b></code>
     from arguments when they are passed to applications. As a result you
     may have to use <code><b>'&nbsp;'</b></code> for POSIX and
     <code><b>"&nbsp;"</b></code> for Windows (<code><b>$</b></code> is
     not treated as a special character on Windows).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you can save regular expression options into
     a file, one option per line, and use this file with the
     <code><b>--options-file</b></code> option. With this approach
     you don't need to worry about shell quoting.</p>

  <h1>DIAGNOSTICS</h1>

  <p>If the input file is not valid C++, <code><b>odb</b></code>
     will issue diagnostic messages to STDERR and exit with non-zero exit
     code.</p>
