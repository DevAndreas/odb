Version 1.1.0

  * Add support for persistent classes without default constructors. For
    objects of such classes only the load() and find() database functions
    that populate an existing instance can be used. Similarly, only the 
    load() query result iterator function which populates an existing 
    instance can be used.

Version 1.0.0

  * Initial release.
